1) collect.py
Code:
Input : twitter data
Output : clusterinput.py,classifyinput.py

Assignment aims at Collecting live data from twitter from 3 fanclub chelseafc arsenal and manutd
My assignment aims to show how these 3 groups are connected what are common followers all 3 groups has 
and what changes happen if we break the link between groups how different communitites are formed
In collect.py i am taking subset of 50 friends and followers of 3 communities
For each common follower i am taking their 20 friend list
I am taking around 100 mentions tweets and description for classification of gender seperately where people have mentioned any of these 3 groups
I am storing users and mention tweets in file clusterinput and classifyinput

Analysis:
collect as we are collecting live data and twitter has rate limit it takes time to get all friends followers
Using rate limit efficiently and storing all data helps in future analyis clustering and classification


2) cluser.py
Code:
Input : clusterinput.py
Output : clusteroutput.py

I am taking data of users/friends and followers that was stored in cluster.py and using partition girven neuman to cluster the communitites
Drawing a network graph of 3 groups Arsenal chelsea manchester united and its friends followers
I am also considering friends of common followers
I am labelling only the three brand groups and its common followers
I am storing the clusters that were obtained from partition to output file clusteroutput.py

Analysis:
After drawing graph we can see that all 3 groups are connected by common followers 
Before the partition the groups are connected to each other by bridge of common followers
After the partition we observe different outputs 
1) Sometimes a different community is formed with the common follower being seperated as one cluster  with its friend.
   All Edge between Common follower and the groups are removed by the community detection algorithm based on betweeness
2) Using Grvan newman sometimes only one of group edge between common follower is removed 
  the follower then is attached to only one of the  group based on betweeneess centrality between edges 
  and breaks the connection between groups 

This data and community cluster tells us that how two nodes in graph are related which edge has high weightage betweeness 
how two different groups are connected how can we break link between them and common followers how they tend to link groups when data is partitioned


3) Classify.py
Input : classifyinput.py
Output : classifyoutput.py

I am classifying people who mentioned any of fanclubs based on their gender
This data gives us information about how many males and females are interested in football teams and mention them in their tweets and talk about the teams in twitter
First of all i am loading data and fitting model based on names for which gender is gound in census data which are known from list
I am taking census data names and matching the users i get who mentions any of fanclub
then for known names i am fitting model based on tweets they made on groups
Also i am taking into consideration description of mentioned users with text as features to predict gender
Also i am tokenizing based on urls and mentions i want to ignore mentions and urls from person attribute to predict gender
As majority people have mentioned those fanclubs or can include url to view i dont want those features to be included in my gender prediction
Also i am creating token pair and token features as i want feature to be based on count: no of times a person has used the feature to predict his or her gender
We are using logistic regression classifier model to fit and predict our data
We need to vectorize and create csr matrix based on features we decide to predict gender

Analysis:
As we see fitting data into logistic regresstion model is challenge 
Sometimes data is skewed and  more in number of only one class parameter 
Our model classifier needs to be fit and be tuned to have  labels of both class male and female
To predict the data accurately we need to fit matrix and label a document properly based on the features in vocab
Based on how we tokenize,vectorize and create feature matrix we can predict more accurately the gender of user
Our classification shows how many people are male female who are interested in football leagues


4)Summarize.py

Input : classifyinput,classifyoutput,clusterinput,clusteroutput
Output:summary.txt
Summarize all data collected based on classification and clustering
We are getting count for no of communitites detected no of users and tweets
We analyse how many people are classified and what their gender is 
How many average users exist in one community

Assignment Analysis:
The whole assignment aims to perform community detection link prediction and classification using machine learning
In this part we are analysing how we can classify live twitter data using logistic regression on any parameter like demographics or sentiments
How we can detect and cluster users into communitites based on community detection algorithms 


Issues/concerns
Because of twitter rate limit data extraction takes time
Sometimes private user profile are not able to be accessed when accessing followers friends
